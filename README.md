# Billcat
Billcat. / ( /bɪl/ /kæt/) / Bill is a cat.

This name more or less comes after [ballcat](https://github.com/ballcat-projects/ballcat), a highly modular spring boot based project with a lot of starters and written by a very talented person! Ballcat is very good for your side projects as well as for learning purpose.

Billcat is a not a replacement, it will focus more on cloud based architecture. 

Hereby, I will copy the needed code directly from ballcat for my common/infrastructure code. They all live happily in the `common` directory :)
